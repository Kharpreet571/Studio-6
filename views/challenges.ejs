        <h2>What Are the Key Challenges for Individuals and Companies?</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">As reported by <em>(Bisht, 2024)</em>, here are some of the most significant data privacy challenges faced today:</p>
        
        <div class="challenges-grid">
            <!-- Challenge Cards -->
            <div class="challenge-card">
                <h3>1. Lack of Data Transparency</h3>
                <p>Many apps collect personal data without clear disclosure about what is stored, how it's used, or shared, leaving users unaware of privacy implications.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="challenge-card">
                <h3>2. Risks of Cloud Computing</h3>
                <p>Storing sensitive data in the cloud carries risks, especially if providers have weak security or data is stored in foreign jurisdictions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="challenge-card">
                <h3>3. Weak Data Protection Laws</h3>
                <p>Many regions lack robust privacy laws, enabling unauthorized data collection and misuse.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="challenge-card">
                <h3>4. Frequent Data Breaches</h3>
                <p>Hacking, human error, or theft can expose personal data, leading to identity theft and financial fraud.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="challenge-card">
                <h3>5. Excessive Data Retention</h3>
                <p>Organizations often retain data longer than necessary, increasing risks of breaches or unauthorized third-party sales.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="challenge-card">
                <h3>6. Emerging Technologies (AI/IoT)</h3>
                <p>AI, IoT, and machine learning collect vast amounts of personal data, raising concerns about unauthorized access or misuse.</p>

            <div class="text-block">
                <h3>Compliance and Implementation Difficulties</h3>
                <p>Despite strict regulations, compliance remains difficult—especially for small businesses—due to high costs and complexity <em>(Tankard, 2016)</em>. Multinational companies also face legal conflicts across jurisdictions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="text-block">
                <h3>Technical Limitations</h3>
                <p>Balancing data utility and privacy is challenging: heavy anonymization reduces research value <em>(Ohm, 2010)</em>, while de-anonymization attacks show even "secure" data can be re-identified <em>(Shmatikov, 2008)</em>.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="text-block">
                <h3>Emerging Privacy Threats</h3>
                <p>AI and big data analytics can extract private details from seemingly anonymous datasets. IoT expands surveillance risks, increasing exposure to leaks.</p>
